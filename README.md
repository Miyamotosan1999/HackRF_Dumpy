# HackRF_Dumpy
STL files for 18650 and speaker mod for portapack

I printed mine at medium resolution on an ender 3 max neo and used cura as the slicer.

Recommend printing with the faceplate down, back(dumpy) using support with flat side down, and battery cover printed on edge vertically all on a raft.
